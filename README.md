## Welcome to my Portfolio

My name is Nuttapong Buttprom, I am  a musician and data science learner. It's nice to meet you, and here are some of my contributions and my passion for data science. You can download my workbook(if data is not confidential) for more details on creating it in the bottom right corner of the chart. Enjoy

### Dashboard
 
- **Public data visualization**

Since [SEAN B](https://www.facebook.com/SeanBuranahiran/) share his [statement](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKdg8ZlZfEL-0CIb0AemPp9Dp28lUSmI?fbclid=IwAR3Dsgc2PY1_KFJlZo1rTVUFg4Cw3oCY_hRc8jhLHSlByla3kcyT8btr3ds)(PDF) for transparecy and apologize of campaign to public [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/SeanBuranahiran/posts/3082422251850578), I wonder how much money is in and out during his campaign, so I made the data in a computer-readable format. And then create this dashboard. [CSILA](https://www.facebook.com/CSILA90210/) (1m+ facebook page) found my work on internet then share it in his [post](https://www.facebook.com/CSILA90210/posts/3152296238181413?d=m) *This visualization is for educational purposes*
