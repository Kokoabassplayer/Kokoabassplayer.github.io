### #MakeoverMonday

I discovered that the more I try to do this project, The more I learn new things. That's because many people compete. And everyone is helping others as well, it's a great community, their work has really inspired me and I believe that practicing through this project will help me become a better Data Analyst.

- **Scotland - The state of the Digital Nation**

I start at 2020 week 33, And this is my first #MakeoverMonday project.
